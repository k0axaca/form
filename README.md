## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-End toolkit

### What I learned

I learned how to make web page using Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [Input group Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/) - This helped me to customize input fields. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Forms Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to make bootstrap forms. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
